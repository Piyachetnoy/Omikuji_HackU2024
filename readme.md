# Project Setup Guide

This document provides step-by-step instructions to set up the Python environment for this project.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python**: Version 3.10.11
- **pip**: Python's package manager (comes pre-installed with Python 3.4+)

You may also want to install a virtual environment tool like `venv` or `virtualenv` to isolate dependencies.

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_directory>
```
---

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

Create and activate a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.

#### On macOS/Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### On Windows:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install the Dependencies
Install the required Python modules listed in `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---

### 4. Configure Your Roboflow API Key

To enable model detection, you need to set up your **Roboflow API key**. Follow these steps:

1. **Install `python-dotenv`**  
    This package allows you to manage environment variables securely.
    ```bash
    pip install python-dotenv
    ```
2. **Create an `.env File`**  
    This file will store your API key.
    ```bash
    touch .env
    ```
3. **Add Your API Key & Photos Management Page Passkey**  
    Open the `.env` file in any text editor and add the following line:
    Replace `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with your actual Roboflow API key.
    Replace `<YOUR_PIN>` with whatever PIN you want.
    ```bash
    ROBOFLOW_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
    ADMIN_PASSWORD=<YOUR_PIN>
    ```

### 5. Running the Project

After completing the installation, you can run the project by executing the appropriate script:
```bash
python app.py
```
